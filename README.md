# Reverse-Parking-Sensor-Project
Code of the Reverse Parking Sensor Project

This project aims to simulate a smart parking system using IoT concepts.
We developed a Reverse Parking Sensor that detects whether a parking spot is occupied or available.

Using ultrasonic sensors and an Arduino, the system provides visual feedback using LED indicators.
The main objective is to create an efficient, low-cost solution to help drivers easily identify free parking spaces.
