# Reverse-Parking-Sensor-Project
Code of the Reverse Parking Sensor Project

This project aims to simulate a smart parking system using IoT concepts.
We developed a Reverse Parking Sensor that detects whether a parking spot is occupied or available.

Using ultrasonic sensors and an Arduino, the system provides visual feedback using LED indicators.
The main objective is to create an efficient, low-cost solution to help drivers easily identify free parking spaces.

COMPONENTS:
- Arduino Uno
- 02 Ultrasonic Sensors 
- 2 Red LEDs
- 2 Green LEDs 
- 4 Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

HOW IT WORKS THE SYSTEM:
1.Sensors measure distance continuously
2.Distance < threshold → Red LED (Occupied)
3.Distance > threshold → Green LED (Available)
4.Repeats automatically
